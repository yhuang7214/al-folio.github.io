In this project, our team of three created an IoT product called the "Smart Plant Care System."
We worked on both hardware(MultiTech xDot, MultiTech Gateway Conduit, Sensor, circuit)
and software(C++, Mbed Studio, AWS IoT Core, AWS DynamoDB, website front-end & back-end).
This system can sense the air and soil environment around plants, showing real-time data on the website.
Plus, it sends email alerts to help users keep an eye on the plant's growing conditions.
